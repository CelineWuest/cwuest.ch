### About

Dinkel is a fuzzer which automatically generates complex and valid [Cypher]() queries.
Cypher is a query language for graph databases made by [Neo4j]() and has seen widespread adoption.
With dinkel, developers can easily test their Cypher implementations with very little setup necessary.

### History

Dinkel is the product of my Bachelor's thesis which I wrote in the [AST Lab at ETH]() under the supervision of [Zu-Ming Jiang]() ad [Zhendong Su]().

I started working on it in February of 2023 and released the 1.0 version in blah blah blah.
