A website for students to learn coding and algorithms, ranging from the simple
Bubble Sort over DH key exchanges to hashing algorithms like SHA. With a
built-in Python interpreter to automatically interpret and check coding exercises. Node.js
was used for the backend.

Developed with two other students, where I was in charge of the main
organization, the whole backend and around half of the articles.

- Winner of the best Technological Graduation Project 2020 at Kanti Baden.
- Currently hosted under [csa.cwuest.ch](https://csa.cwuest.ch).
