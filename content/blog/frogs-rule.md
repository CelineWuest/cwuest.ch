I like frogs :)  
So here's a whole blog post dedicated to information about them!

## What is a Frog?

Frogs are short-bodied, tailless Amphibia composing the order Anura (from the Ancient Greek: ἀνούρα, meaning *without tail*).
They make up 88% of extant (the opposite of extinct) amphibian species.

The exact characteristics of frogs include a lot of specific details on spinal structure and complexion of certain bones, among other things.
But mostly, you can recognize frogs by their absence of a tail and their long hind limbs made for jumping.

### Frogs vs Toads

{{< figure src="/blog/frogs-rule/american-toad.jpg" alt="American Toad" caption="American Toad, part of the true-toad family (nps.gov)" class="w-1/3 float-right text-center mt-5 ml-1 mb-0" >}}

People usually refer to warty frogs as toads.
However, the distinction between "frog" and "toad" is not defined, as there is no set rule in taxonomy governing which is which.

There does exist a family of so-called "true-toads", with species in the family Bufonidae being referred to as such.
Over 500 species make up the family of Bufonidae and they are found all over the world, except for parts of Oceania.
These animals are in general more warty in appearance, but what sets them apart from the general frog are their parotid glands on the side of their heads.
These glands secrete a poison which the true toads use to repel, or even kill predators.

## Distribution and Habitat

Frogs can be found on all continents, excluding Antarctica.

Their habitats vary greatly between different species of frog.
Some can be found in aquatic habitats, but others like strolling through sand dunes.
Other habitats include rainforests, woodlands and parks or gardens.

Most like it warm and damp, with the highest concentration of frogs being in tropical regions.

## Diet

Frogs are a mainly carnivorous group, mostly snacking on insects, spiders, worms and slugs.
However, there are exceptions to this.
There exist some species which go for larger prey, their diet consisting of mice, birds and small reptiles.

Frogs do not drink water!  
They rely on their semi-permeable skin to absorb water directly from their surroundings.
This feature also allows them to take up oxygen underwater, allowing them to breathe while submerged.
Unfortunately, this also makes them very susceptible to pollution, as the frogs absorb pollutants as well which can lead to their death.

## Reproduction and Lifecycle

{{< figure src="/blog/frogs-rule/frogspawn.jpg" alt="Frogspawn" caption="Frogspawn (cafnr.missouri.edu)" class="w-1/3 float-right text-center m-0" >}}

Frogs lay eggs (groups of which are referred to as *frogspawn*) which later hatch into tadpoles.
Fertilization occurs externally, meaning that the male fertilizes the female's eggs after they have been released.
Per individual mating, frogs can expel between 3'000 and 20'000 eggs.

This process is usually done in water, so as to avoid drying out the eggs.
A few frog species differ in this regard, sometimes laying eggs in soil (in the case of *Colostethus machalilla*), or carrying the eggs around in pouches (which is how the *horned marsupial frog* does it).  
The monogamous mimic poison frog lies eggs on a plant with the father later carrying the hatched tadpoles to bodies of water.

Two to nine days after fertilization, the tadpoles break the egg barrier and hatch.
After hatching, the tadpole's parents often defend them from predators to ensure their survival.

A tadpole is born with gills and a tail.
Through the tadpole's process of metamorphosis, it begins to develop lungs, losing its gills in the process, and starts growing legs.
The tadpole's hind legs start developing before the fore legs.
At the end of metamorphosis, the tadpole loses its tail, absorbing it into its body, completing its transition into being a frog!  
Between the tadpole hatching and it turning into a young frog, around 22 to 25 weeks have passed on average.

## Size

The sizes of different frog species are influenced by many factors, mainly their habitat.
Tree frogs are generally smaller than aquatic frogs.

The largest frogs to have ever lived, that we know of, are the Beelzebufo.
Bellzebufo roamed the earth 70 million years ago and measured in at 42.5cm, with an estimated weight of 4.5kg!

The largest living frog species, that we know of, is the Goliath Frog which can grow up to 32cm in length and weight up to 3.3kg.

{{< figure src="/blog/frogs-rule/paedophryne-amauensis.png" alt="Paedophryne Amauensis" caption="Paedophryne Amauensis, the smallest frog species that we know of (wikimedia.org)" class="w-2/5 float-left text-center mt-2.5 mr-4 mb-1" >}}

The smallest species of frog, that we know of, is the Paedophryne Amauensis.
This species of frog is about as big as a housefly, measuring at 7.7 millimeters, thereby holding the record of being the smallest vertebrate.
Its weight is not well documented with measurements ranging from a miniscule 0.7 to 10 milligrams.

This means that the weight of a Goliath Frog is 330'000-4'750'000 times that of the Paedophryne Amauensis!

Now unfortunately this section is not about frogs in labcoats, sorry if you were expecting that. </br>
As compensation, I have asked midjourney to generate such an image for you.
